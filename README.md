# MoonBrook Ridge 🌾

A farming and life simulation game inspired by Stardew Valley with enhanced NPC interaction systems similar to The Sims 4, **plus survival mechanics** (hunger and thirst). Built with MonoGame (C#).

## 🎮 Game Features

### Survival Mechanics ⭐ NEW
- **Hunger System**: Depletes over time, faster during strenuous activities
- **Thirst System**: Depletes faster than hunger, critical for survival
- **Activity-Based Decay**: Running, mining, and tool use drain stats faster
- **Debuff System**: Low hunger reduces movement speed; low thirst drains extra energy
- **Critical State**: When hunger/thirst reach zero, health starts draining
- **Blackout Mechanic**: Player blacks out if health drops to zero from starvation/dehydration
- **Visual Warnings**: HUD shows critical warnings when stats are dangerously low
- **Consumables**: Food items restore hunger, drinks restore thirst

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shifty81/MoonBrook-Ridge.git
cd MoonBrook-Ridge
./play.sh
```

### Manual Building

### Playtest Guide

**New!** See [PLAYTEST_GUIDE.md](PLAYTEST_GUIDE.md) for:
- How to test the complete farming loop (till → plant → water → harvest)
- Currently implemented features and controls
- Tips for effective playtesting
- Known limitations and troubleshooting

### Development

The project uses MonoGame's Content Pipeline for asset management. To add new sprites:

1. Place sprite files in the `Content/` directory
2. Add them to `Content.mgcb` using the MGCB Editor
3. Load them in code using `Content.Load<Texture2D>("filename")`
